<h3>Here is why number 7 is the best number!</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When asked to pick a random number between 1 and 10, the most likely answer for a person to pick is 7 because it's seen as the "most random" for some reason!</li>
    <li>You can draw a line between it and it'll still be 7 which is cool!</li>
    <li>I said so</li>
    <li>In the Harry Potter books and movies 7 is seen as a magical number because of how much it appears in the series (7 books, 7 school years, 7 is Harry's Quidditch team number, 7 Horcruxes, 7 floors at Hogwarts, etc.) and I'm an avid Harry Potter enjoyer</li>
    <li>In terms of numbers it's pretty hot compared to the rest</li>
    <li>There are 10 places on the list, and number 10 - number 7 = number 3, illuminati confirmed</li>
</ul>the list, illuminati confirmed</li>
