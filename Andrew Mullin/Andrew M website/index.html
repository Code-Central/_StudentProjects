        <p>First, I'm going to eliminate emerald block, because 
            you can trade with villagers to get it <em>very</em> quickly</p>
            <p>That leaves Netherite block, Emerald Ore, Bedrock, Budding Amethyst, Beacon, And Gilded Blackstone </p>

        <h1>Second elimination</h1>
        <img src="images/Bedrock.jpg">
        <p> While it is very difficult to obtain in survival, only members of scicraft know how to do the glitch. And bedrock is under no circumstances hard to find. </p>
