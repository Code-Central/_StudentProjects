        <h1> Some might say its obvious, but those people are idiots. </h1>
        <h2>I will be stating the rarest block to place/ obtain.</h2>

        <p> Netherite Block</p>
        <p> Emerald Ore</p>
        <p> Bedrock (there is a glitch)</p>
        <p> Budding Amethyst </p>
        <p> Emerald Block</p>
        
        <h1> First Elimination</h1>
        <p>First, I'm going to eliminate emerald block, because 
            you can trade with villagers to get it <em>very</em> quickly</p>
            <p>That leaves Netherite block, Emerald Ore, Bedrock</p>
